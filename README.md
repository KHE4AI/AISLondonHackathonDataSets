# AISLondonHackathonDataSets
Instructions for mapping the data sets:
1. Take the columns from the attached file Agriculture Dataset_text.csv other than Area and Year and find the names of the products within them (for example the third column is Cereals excluding rice).
2. Take the above names and for each find the best match in the Shrt_Desc column of the attached ABBREV.xlsx. Record these matches in some form of file or mapping. This can be done by hand or by code, there are only 14 unique products in the file.
3. Take the remaining nutritional columns in ABBREV.xlsx ( from Water_(g) onwards) and map them to the daily nutritional requirements data in the attached file daily_nutrients.xlsx. Again this can be done by hand or by code. Not everything will have an equivalent.
